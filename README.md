Fruity Blade

I created a fun and interactive Fruit Ninja game where fruits randomly appear on the screen, and you use your cursor as a sword to slice them, with a satisfying swish sound every time you hit one! Each object in the game moves at its own speed as I have assigned velocities by using '**setVelocityXEach(0)**' command making the action feel dynamic and exciting. The background can be changed by a toggle to a cool, techy design, and there’s a score counter to track how well you're doing. But watch out for the germ—if you touch it, the game ends!
To make the game run smoothly, I used the '**SetCollider**' function to make sure the sword correctly interacts with the fruits and germ. I also worked with images by breaking them into small 10-pixel chunks, allowing for better control and accuracy when processing them. It’s a mix of fun gameplay, real-time interaction, and precision to keep the experience engaging!!
